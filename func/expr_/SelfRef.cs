	/// In the 1930s, Curry's paradox and the related Kleene–Rosser paradox played a major role in showing that formal logic systems based on self-recursive expressions are inconsistent. These include some versions of lambda calculus and combinatory logic.

	/// Lambda calculus is a consistent theory in its own domain.
	/// To avoid self-referencing inconsistency, we need type. Type can be statically checked to ensure consistency.
