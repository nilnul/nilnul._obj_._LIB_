	/// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding
	/// <summary>
	/// In mathematics, Church encoding is a means of representing data and operators in the lambda calculus.
	/// Terms that are usually considered primitive in other notations (such as integers, booleans, pairs, lists, and tagged unions) are mapped to higher-order functions under Church encoding. 
	/// </summary>
	/// In the untyped lambda calculus the only primitive data type is the function.
